# dotfiles

Here, basic config files are kept.

Run the `create_links.sh` script to generate symbolic links to the home directory.

Currently only the following config files are included:

* vim
* tmux

## tmux config

Currently the following setup is used.

* `Ctrl+b` then `s` to split pane horizontally
* `Ctrl+b` then `v` to split pane vertically
* `alt+h j k l` to change window, in a vim-like manner
* `alt+-` and `alt++` to alter vertical spacing
* `alt+<` and `alt+>` to alter horizontal spacing
